# pizza-sales-sql-powerbi
In this project, I performed data analysis using SQL queries and created an interactive dashboard using Power BI. The dataset contains pizza orders from January to December 2015. The goal was to analyze KPIs and visualize trends, sales distribution, and best/worst performing products.
